# Decoding-natural-movie

Decoding visual stimuli (natural movie frames) from neural activity across different brain regions and behavioural states using datasets from the Allen Brain Institute. 

ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview:

1. **SVM Decoders**:
   - Contains all code related to Support Vector Machine (SVM) decoders and decoding accuracy results.
2. **Behavioral States**:
   - Explores how different behavioral states impact decoding outcomes.
3. **Decoder RF (Receptive Fields)**:
   - Deals with image reconstruction.
4. **GLM**:
   - Utilises Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to predict neural firing rates.

## Usage
Unzip and open with Matlab and Jupyter notebook (Matlab kernal).

## Datasets
In this study, we analysed publicly available datasets provided by the Allen Brain Institute. You can find the data at this link: https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels
