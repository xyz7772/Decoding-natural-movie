# Decoding-natural-movie

Decoding visual stimuli (natural movie frames) from neural activity across different brain regions and behavioural states using datasets from the Allen Brain Institute. 

ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview:

1. **SVM Decoders**:
   - This section contains all code related to Support Vector Machine (SVM) decoders. Navigate here if you're interested in decoding information from neural data using SVM.
2. **Behavioral States**:
   - In this directory, you'll find code that explores how different behavioral states impact decoding outcomes. We investigate the effects of behavioral state variations on decoding accuracy.
3. **Decoder RF (Receptive Fields)**:
   - The code in this segment deals with image reconstruction. Based on the receptive fields of the decoder, we attempt to reconstruct the original input images.
4. **GLM (Generalized Linear Models)**:
   - For the neural encoding portion, we utilize Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to predict neural firing rates. Head over to this section if you're curious about predicting neural responses from input stimuli.

ðŸ”— Ensure you've installed all necessary dependencies and follow the guidelines for a smooth execution of the code.

## Usage
Unzip and open with Matlab and Jupyter notebook (Matlab kernal).

## Datasets
In this study, we analysed publicly available datasets provided by the Allen Brain Institute. You can find the data at this link: https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels
